## Goal

Automate the lifecycle of a machine learning model — from data to model training, deployment, and monitoring — using the provided Python scripts.
Focus on demonstrating automation, continuous update capabilities, and system monitoring within a realistic (but minimal) MLOps workflow.

## Resources

- get_data.py
- train_model.py
- evaluate_model.py

## Tasks

Automatically generate and save new data at regular intervals.
Train the model on new data, and save new parameters automatically.
"Deploy" the best model at any time by saving to a production directory with version tracking.
